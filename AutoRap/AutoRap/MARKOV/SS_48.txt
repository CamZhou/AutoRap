But do not so; Mine be thy love and am beloved Where I may not remove nor be removed. that love and look another way: What can mine own self bring? O, To hear with eyes belongs to love's fine wit. poor, But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive, that best I wish in thee: If ten of thine ten times refigured thee: But day doth daily draw my sorrows longer And night doth nightly make grief's strength seem to decay, But wherefore do not so; 'thou single wilt prove none.' Then can I fortune to brief minutes tell, Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate Which to repair should be thy chief desire. Which happies those that pay the willing loan; A man in hue, O, Then let not winter's ragged hand deface In thee thy summer, The pain be mine, When day's oppression is not eased by night, They do but sweetly chide thee, of small worth held: Attending on his celestial face, Which in thy abundance am sufficed And by addition me of thee this I prognosticate: If all were minded so, if thou issueless shalt hap to die.
