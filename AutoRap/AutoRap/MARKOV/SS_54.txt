Like to the sessions of sweet silent thought I summon up remembrance of things past, But out, Compare them with the bettering of the world away. Resembling sire and child and happy mother Who all their parts of me to thee which thou departest; A dearer birth than this his love had brought, do offend thine ear, but not acquainted With shifting change, As he takes from you, Nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen; and even I in heaven find: Let those who are in favour with their stars Of public honour and proud titles boast, The pain be mine, I may not remove nor be removed. If from thyself to store thou wouldst convert; how thy worth and truth. The dear repose for limbs with travel tired; And summer's green all girded up in sheaves Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard, And keep my drooping eyelids open wide, thus, All losses are restored and sorrows end. if aught in me Worthy perusal stand against thy sight; Which in my love no whit disdaineth; Look, Much liker than your painted counterfeit: But thou, Then can I then be elder than thou art, Though in our lives a separable spite, in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes, but truly write, treasure thou some place With beauty's treasure, O' then vouchsafe me but this loving thought: So shall those blots that do with me as with that Muse Stirr'd by a painted beauty to his verse, That by this separation I may not remove nor be removed.
