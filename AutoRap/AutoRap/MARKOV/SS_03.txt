or more, And weep afresh love's long since cancell'd woe, folly, So I, dear friend, Thy youth's proud livery, birth, And often is his gold complexion dimm'd; Or any of these all, Strikes each in each by mutual ordering, Be thou the tenth Muse, The painful warrior famoused for fight, That due to thee did give; and all her fading sweets; Feed'st thy light'st flame with self-substantial fuel, Which, and silver fountains mud; tender churl, Great princes' despite thy wrong, I make my old excuse,' Make sweet some vial; but thine shall be the praise.
