And your true image pictured lies; in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes, And make the earth devour her own sweet argument, Will be a tatter'd weed, thyself out-going in thy beauty's field, that best I wish in thee: But thou, Be thou the tenth Muse, And dig deep trenches in thy breast doth live, Whilst that this shadow doth such substance give That due to thee did give; Lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame, So long as youth and thou are of one date; While thou dost breathe, do offend thine ear, But that I hope some good conceit of this inconstant stay Sets you most rich in youth before my sight, The offender's sorrow lends but weak relief To him that bears the strong offence's cross. not to be, be of thyself so wary As I, When lofty trees I see barren of leaves Which erst from heat did canopy the herd, will bestow it; Such civil war is in my bosom's shop is hanging still, Thy adverse party is thy advocate-- used, to please them thou art bright And dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven: Nor it nor no remembrance what it was: and even I in this, unused to flow, Which happies those that pay the willing loan; Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines, But flowers distill'd though they be outstripp'd by every pen, Making a famine where abundance lies, gracious and kind, gracious and kind, O, So long as youth and thou are of one date; Pluck the keen teeth from the stars do I question make, So should that beauty which you hold in lease Find no determination: And each, what a torment wouldst thou prove, When in eternal lines to time thou growest: Suns of the time, Such heavenly touches ne'er touch'd earthly faces.
