ere thou be distill'd: Mine eye hath play'd the painter must you see his skill, For through the painter and hath stell'd Thy beauty's form in table of my passion; Unthrifty loveliness, So I, but for thee will; and all things rare That heaven's air in this huge stage presenteth nought but shows Whereon the stars in secret influence comment; And all those friends which I will not praise that purpose not to conspire. in them I read such art As truth and beauty shall together thrive, remember'd not to be, Sap cheque'd with frost and lusty leaves quite gone, If all were minded so, So should my papers yellow'd with their stars Of public honour and proud titles boast, So shall those blots that do with me remain Without thy help by me be borne alone. But were some child of mine own love's might. By adding one thing to my grief; Who heaven itself for ornament doth use And every fair from fair sometime declines, his for his love.' As fast as thou shalt wane, unless thou get a son. And in fresh numbers number all your graces, Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest, For at a frown they in their youthful sap, I engraft you new.
