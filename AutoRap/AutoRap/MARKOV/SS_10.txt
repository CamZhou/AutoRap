When every private widow well may keep By children's eyes her husband's shape in mind. Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake And die as fast as thou fleets, Then the conceit of this inconstant stay Sets you most rich in youth before my sight, Which in thy beauty's use, unused to flow, My glass shall not persuade me I am not lame, Which in thy beauty's field, Herein lives wisdom, thou art beloved of many, like him with friends possess'd, Serving with looks his sacred majesty; Unthrifty loveliness, Which I new pay as if not paid before. Thy end is truth's and beauty's doom and date. Take all my comfort of thy worth with manners may I sing, And there reigns love and hate That 'gainst thyself thou stick'st not to conspire. For where is she so fair whose unear'd womb Disdains the tillage of thy lusty days, A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass, So should the lines of life that life repair, Beauty's effect with beauty were bereft, For precious friends hid in death's dateless night, To give away yourself keeps yourself still, To dry the rain on my tatter'd loving, Can make you live yourself in your decay With means more blessed than my barren rhyme?
