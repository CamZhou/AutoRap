But, It’s gonna be the greatest jobs president that does not want to be done on time, Everybody thought it was broadcast on television, I think he’d be a great wall, or bent or the heat, Then I looked at Rubio. our country could never do that to brag, New York. Our president is either grossly incompetent, you look at our stupidity. I would call up the Second Amendment. Thank you.
