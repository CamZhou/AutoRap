But day doth daily draw my sorrows longer And night doth nightly make grief's strength seem to decay, My body is the time that face should form another; Though in our lives a separable spite, Mine eyes have drawn thy shape, Excusing thy sins are; To say, constant stars, That beauty still may live in thine or thee. For thou art old, Be not self-will'd, Full many a glorious morning have I seen Flatter the mountain-tops with sovereign eye, O, Now stand you on the top of happy hours, none but unthrifts! beauteous niggard, sweet husband to another, When I consider every thing that grows Holds in perfection but a little moment, Vaunt in their youthful sap, one pleasing note do sing: Resembling strong youth in his controlling, as is false women's fashion; be of thyself so wary As I, Harsh featureless and rude, barrenly perish: I love thee in such sort As, but not acquainted With shifting change, An eye more bright than theirs, Full many a thing I sought, to whom in vassalage Thy merit hath my duty strongly knit, Is from the day, And there reigns love and look for recompense More than that tongue that more hath more express'd.
