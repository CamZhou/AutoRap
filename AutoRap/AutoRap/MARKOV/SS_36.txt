With sun and moon, not for their rhyme, Nor it nor no remembrance what it was: Till then not show my wit: Which happies those that pay the willing loan; my love no whit disdaineth; They do but sweetly chide thee, Then may I sing, So is it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave To entertain the time that face should form another; and she in thee lie! therefore, my love engrafted to this store: Neither in inward worth nor outward fair, Let them say more than thy sins are; and thine image dies with thee. Whilst that this shadow doth such substance give That I an accessary needs must be twain, Which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive, let my books be then the eloquence And dumb presagers of my heart, Which this, Unthrifty loveliness, That use is not forbidden usury, Which I by lacking have supposed dead, My body is the time that face should form another; Whose strength's abundance weakens his own heart.
